# ELPaaS
ELPaaS(Event Log Privacy as a Service) is a web based tool, that allow users to apply state of the art privacy algorithms from the process mining domain to their event logs. The algorithms provided include PRETSA (https://github.com/samadeusfp/PRETSA) and differential privacy queries for event logs. 

We welcome other researchers to integrate their privacy algorithms for process mining in our tool. If you are interested in doing so please contact us under: Stephan.Fahrenkrog-Petersen || hu-berlin.de
